//! A live tree-sitter document: the tree is the source of truth, edits are
//! applied to it directly, and highlights are queried straight off it for
//! whatever byte range is on screen.
//!
//! This is the opposite arrangement to [`super::prepared`], which identifies a
//! document by a hash of its whole text and materializes per-line tokens into
//! 64-line chunks on a worker thread. That design suits the diff views, where
//! the text is immutable and the same document is scrolled repeatedly. It suits
//! an *editable* buffer badly: every keystroke changes the hash, so the document
//! and all of its chunks are discarded and the viewport falls back to heuristic
//! tokens until the worker catches up.
//!
//! Here the document outlives its edits. `tree.edit()` shifts the existing tree
//! into the new coordinates synchronously, the reparse reuses it, and rendering
//! walks a `QueryCursor` over the visible range. Nothing is materialized per
//! line, so there is no cache to invalidate and no pending state to report.
//!
//! The document holds a [`Rope`] rather than a contiguous buffer: the parser
//! reads it a chunk at a time, query predicates read node text the same way,
//! and edit positions come off the rope's summaries. So neither parsing nor
//! querying ever needs the buffer assembled into one string, and holding a
//! snapshot across a background reparse costs an atomic increment.
//!
//! Used by file editors and the merge tool's editable resolved output.
